Hey there! 
Nice to meet you all.
I am Sneha Das from EEE department.
My roll no. is 220108058.
I am from Kolkata, West Bengal.
Honestly speaking, I am an extrovert and obviously that proves how much I love 
to speak :|
Painting and reading novels are my two hobbies.
If you guys ever need any suggestions regarding books and novels, feel free to 
reach out to me ;)
I hope that I will get recruited in Coding Club and be a part of this family
soon.
Hoping for the best!
Fingers crossed!!
